        <h2>The &lsquo;Jimmy Fallon Effect&rsquo;</h2>
        <p>Within a short period, Jimmy Fallon went from an SNL alum with a somewhat struggling career in Hollywood to the host of one of the most respected franchises in entertainment.</p>

        <p>It was not by accident.</p>

        <p>Without a doubt, Fallon&#39;s meteoric rise is partly due to his intense focus on developing relationships with the right people who could advance his career. </p>

        <p>His networking approach was not some cunning manipulation but instead came from a genuine interest in professionally connecting with influencers.</p>

        <h2>What Made The Difference</h2>

        <p>Have you ever wondered what makes a difference in people&#39;s lives? It isn&#39;t a native intelligence or talent or dedication. It isn&#39;t that one person wants success, and the other doesn&#39;t.</p>

        <p>The difference lies in whom you know and how you make use of your network.</p>

        <p>The Hunt For 100 is a unique method. It does an amazing job of building a professional network of business opportunities and gives you actionable suggestions that anyone can use. </p>

        <h2>A Method Unlike Any Other</h2>

        <p>If you are already good at networking, this method will help you become better. If you are nervous and don&#39;t know how to even start, it will help you there as well. </p>

        <p>I am recommending this to anyone who wants to get better at developing a professional network and advancing their careers or professional interests. </p>

        <p>The Hunt For 100 gives you all the business advantage you need&mdash;when you need it.</p>

        <h2>Your Network Is Your Power</h2>

        <p>The most important thing you can do to quickly grow your business is network. Networking has a bigger impact than education, marketing, and anything else you do for your business. </p>

        <p>Not only is networking a shortcut to success, but it also helps build long term relationships. These relationships are the key to your business. </p>

        <p>Networking is one of those areas that entrepreneurs know they should focus on but rarely do enough. </p>

        <p>By making networking a priority, you will not only gain more contacts but also gain more deals. The deals you do get will have a much greater chance of making it to the closing table. </p>

        <p>Regardless of where you are in your business, you need to constantly focus on networking. The Hunt For 100 is the best way to get started.</p>

        <h2>Don&rsquo;t invest in A Method but a Life skill</h2>

        <p>You&#39;ve no doubt heard it a million times: Success in business is as much about whom you know as what you know &mdash; and that&#39;s exactly why being a powerful networker is so important.</p>

        <p>The Hunt for 100 helps you build this valuable life skill for only $149.95/yr</p>

        <p>You will see it is the best investment you can make for yourself and your business.</p>

        <h2>An Investment In Success</h2>

        <p>We thrive by helping each other grow. Building relationships is such an important skill. Every person you meet is a vault containing a wealth of insight, knowledge, and opportunities. As you get to know people, you get to share that wealth and
            use it to make your own life richer and more successful.</p>
        <p>Having a large, diverse network is critical to success. </p>
